                <h2>11. Special Notification for residents in California, U.S.</h2>
                <p><strong>1) Data Protection Rights</strong><br>
                    If you are a resident of California, under applicable laws such as the California Consumer Privacy
                    Act (CCPA), you have certain data protection rights, including:</p>
                <p><strong>(1)</strong> Right to be informed. You have the right to request that we disclose information
                    we collect or store about you.</p>
                <p><strong>(2)</strong> Right to request deletion. You have the right to request that we delete your
                    personal information upon your request, but please be aware that if there are exceptions under CCPA
                    law, we will retain your personal information for legitimate and legal reasons.</p>
                <p><strong>(3)</strong> Right to restrict the processing of your personal information. You have the
                    right to restrict us from using or disclosing your personal information, especially in the
                    collection of sensitive information, but in practice, we do not collect any sensitive information
                    from you without your consent.</p>
                <p><strong>(4)</strong> Right to request correction. You have the right to request correction of
                    inaccurate personal information we collect or you provide to us. You also have the right to opt-out
                    of "selling" or "sharing". We do not sell your personal information, so we do not offer this opt-out
                    option. Generally, we do not share your personal information unless it is with your explicit consent
                    or under legally required circumstances defined by the CCPA. If you have any requests, you may
                    contact us for processing.</p>

                <p>Requests related to the above rights will be processed within 45 days after clarifying and verifying
                    your identity according to CCPA regulations. If necessary, we may extend the processing time and
                    will notify you accordingly.</p>

                <p><strong>2) Data Retention</strong><br>
                    We retain information for a reasonable period in accordance with CCPA to fulfill the purposes
                    described in this policy (e.g., to comply with our legal obligations, manage internal records,
                    enforce our terms, and resolve disputes), unless a longer retention period is required or permitted
                    by law.</p>

                <p><strong>3) Authorized Agent</strong><br>
                    Under applicable laws like the CCPA, you may submit written requests via an authorized agent. If you
                    wish to designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights and choices on your behalf, please
                    provide written proof that your agent is authorized to do so. If the agent fails to submit written
                    evidence to prove they are authorized by you to act on your behalf and/or the agent's identity
                    cannot be verified, we will deny the agent's request.</p>

                <p><strong>4) Processing of Sensitive Information</strong><br>
                    In fact, we do not collect any of your sensitive information, nor do we sell, share, or disclose
                    your personal sensitive information to any third parties. You can directly contact us to inquire
                    about this, but we will require you to provide appropriate identity verification and reasonably
                    review your claims in accordance with relevant regulations.</p>

                <p><strong>5) Sharing, Transferring, Selling, and Disclosing Data</strong><br>
                    According to definitions related to "sharing," "transferring," and "disclosing" in the applicable
                    CCPA laws, we do not share, transfer, or disclose any of your personal information to any third
                    party without your consent. Please be aware that we do not engage in the sale of user's personal
                    information, and there have been no such acts in the previous 12 months.</p>
